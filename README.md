Press **F** ⌨️ or **RB** 🎮 while in the air to do flips!

You can also do **backflips** and **sideflips** for maximum parkour expression. 🌟

**Best of all:** If you land a flip successfully, you'll restore your stamina! ❇️

# Known Issues

-   **Flip consistency:** The flip force is a little inconsistent. Sometimes you'll fall on your forehead and sometimes you'll be sent flying. I'll likely be adjusting these in future releases.

-   **Camera pitch when flipping**: The camera sometimes leans left and right when you're flipping forward, especially when sprinting. This is pretty disorientating, and that's not a great emotion to experience.
