🧗‍♂️ **Now you can climb in your parkour game!** 🤸‍♂️

Press **F** ⌨️ or **RB** 🎮 while in the air to do flips!

You can also do **backflips** and **sideflips** for maximum parkour expression. 🌟

**Best of all:** If you land a flip successfully, you'll restore your stamina! ❇️

# Known Issues

- **Multiplayer Syncing:** For some reason, players can't see each other flip. You'll still get your stamina back, but no one will know how sick your flip was :(

- **Flip consistency:** The flip force is a little inconsistent. Sometimes you'll fall on your forehead and sometimes you'll be sent flying. I'll likely be adjusting these in future releases.

# Config

| Option | Description | Default |
| ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| **Keyboard Keybind** | Keyboard key used to trigger flips. | `F` |
